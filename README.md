/TG/station mapper,

## How to Contact Me (don't)

Join my Discord server or contnact me through one of the SS13 servers I'm in. Or coderbus if you're not banned.

My friend requests are off so I'm not putting my Discord ID here.

Keep your head held up high, you can accomplish anything.

I don't know what else to put here anymore.
