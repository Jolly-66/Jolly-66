# Hi. Hello. Welcome. Something.

He/Him

I'm Jolly, an inept SS13 coder and somewhat existing mapper.

/TG/station mapper,

Skyrat Maptainer (currently inactive),

TaleStation Project Lead,

Fulltime Bio student at college.

If you need to contact me, your best methods are:
- ~~Discord: Jolly#0512~~ Please contact me in either of the following Discords: /TG/station, Skyrat, Shiptest, Sector Echo 13, AculaStation, TaleStation, Mapper's Palace, Coderbus.

Keep your head held up high, you can accomplish anything.

## PLEASE DO NOT PR TO ANY OF MY FORKS!!
I do NOT check my forks. If you have intentions to help me with something, please reach out to me on Discord, otherwise, I won't see anything you PR.

## Times I fucked up /TG/ unintentionally
- Broke ruins spawning 
- Broke uniforms 

## JOLLY'S INFAMOUS LIST OF STUFF TO DO BUT NOT TO DO
Whats this?
I used to have stuff here but I kept forgetting to update it. Lol. Look at the commit history if you care enough.
Did you know I have a bad habit of forgetting what I'm supposed to do?
