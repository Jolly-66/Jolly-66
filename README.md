# Hi. Hello. Welcome. Something.

He/Him

I'm Jolly, an inept SS13 coder and somewhat existing mapper.

Currently, I help run JollyStation, a HRP-oriented RP server using /TG/ Station as our base.
You can find me bouncing between there and /TG/ Station itself contributing.

If you need to contact me, your best methods are:
- Discord: Jolly#0512
- Twitter: Jolly66_
- Email: jolly.66.dragon@gmail.com

Keep your head held up high, you can accomplish anything.
